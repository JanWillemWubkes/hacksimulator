  1. Consistency with brand identity
Don’t let your landing page be the odd one out. Ensure it’s in sync with your brand’s DNA, even if it’s linked to a standalone campaign with a different look and feel.

Match your design elements and messaging to create a seamless user journey from ad to sale.


2. Focus on a single, clear objective
Your landing page has one job. Don’t dilute its power with distractions like multiple links to other pages, paid ads and too many secondary CTAs.

Landing pages with one link convert at 13.5%, while those with five or more links drop to 10.5%.


3. Use of space and minimalistic design

What Makes a Great Landing Page?
Landing pages are the workhorses of online conversion. These web pages serve as your 24/7 digital sales team, tirelessly turning visitors into leads and customers.

The secret to a successful, high-converting landing page is focus. Unlike a homepage with its buffet of options, a landing page should convince the visitor to click on a single, crystal-clear call to action (CTA). In other words, a well-crafted landing page delivers results.

To harness the full power of landing pages, it’s essential to understand their anatomy, best practices and optimization techniques.

Let’s consider key elements before exploring our list of best practices and the 20 best landing page examples.

A clear and compelling title
The title on your landing page should pack a punch. Up to 80% of visitors only read the title (or headline), so make it count.

A captivating title hooks web visitors and keeps them engaged, setting the stage for taking a desired action. Spend a bit of time on this and create an attention-grabbing headline.

Strong, relevant visuals
Make a visual impact on your landing page and let your hero image act as a digital billboard that sets the tone in seconds. People retain 80% of what they see but only 20% of what they read, so choose your visuals wisely.

Opt for bold, eye-catching images and graphics that illustrate your offer. Infographics, for example, can boost engagement by 80%. Video pays dividends here, too and can increase conversions by 86%.

But remember, fast loading times are crucial. Oversized images can significantly slow down your page, potentially driving visitors away before seeing your content.

Concise and persuasive copy
Keep the copy on your landing pages concise and persuasive—visitors prefer to skim, not read.

Stick to one strong marketing message per page because multiple messages can negatively impact conversions. Instead, craft targeted landing pages for different promotions, messages and customer segments.

To make the page easy to scan, consider using bullet points, short paragraphs and subtitles.

A strong call to action
Your CTA is where the conversion magic finally happens, so take time to craft a CTA that’s impossible to ignore.

Position the CTA front and center and ensure it stands out on the page. Note that landing pages with one CTA convert 1.6% better than those with multiple. Then, level up by personalizing it, as tailored CTAs outperform generic ones by 202%, and consider using the word “submit” where it makes sense, as this verb could boost conversions by 3%.

Button color can help you generate leads, too. Use contrasting hues to make your CTAs stand out from other visual elements. Worth noting: Green CTAs on landing pages outperform other color variations.

Trust signals (testimonials, reviews, certifications)
Testimonials and reviews are the modern-day equivalent of word-of-mouth recommendations. Real customer voices build trust faster than company claims, accelerating conversions.

When adding trust signals to your landing page, remember that testimonials trump reviews: 36% of top-performing landing pages have testimonials compared to just 11% for reviews.

Including your contact details also boosts trust and encourages visitors to get in touch. In fact, adding these details can give your conversion rate a lift of up to 9%.

Mobile responsiveness
A mobile-first approach is essential for boosting conversion rates. Currently, 53.3% of web traffic originates from mobile devices, so a mobile landing page UI design needs to shine on smaller screens.

Think thumb-friendly layouts, swift load times and content that can be consumed on the go.

Fast loading speed
Your landing pages should be lightning-fast across all devices. Every second of load time translates into a 4.42% drop in conversions.

Pages loading in 1-2 seconds hit the sweet spot. Remember to optimize images, keep your code clean and leverage browser caching to speed things up.

Your website’s homepage is your most important landing page, so ensure this page loads lightning-fast. But don’t forget to check the speed of your other landing pages, too. Note that a heavy background image can slow things down considerably.

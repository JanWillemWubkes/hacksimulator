Please add a session summary following this two-tier approach:

1. **SESSIONS.md**: Add detailed session log (full details: problems, solutions, commits, files changed)
2. **CLAUDE.md**: Extract and add ONLY key learnings to the "Key Learnings" section using this format:

```markdown
### [Topic] (Sessie X)
⚠️ **Never:**
- Anti-pattern 1 (reason)
- Anti-pattern 2 (reason)

✅ **Always:**
- Best practice 1 (reason)
- Best practice 2 (reason)
```

**Guidelines:**
- Focus on actionable anti-patterns and best practices
- Keep CLAUDE.md entry to 5-7 bullets per session
- NO commit details in CLAUDE.md (those go in SESSIONS.md)
- Rotate: When 5+ sessions in CLAUDE.md, compress oldest entries

**Goal:** Context carry-over between sessions WITHOUT bloating CLAUDE.md

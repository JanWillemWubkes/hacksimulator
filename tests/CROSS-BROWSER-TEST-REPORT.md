### ‚ö†Ô∏è WebKit/Safari (Deferred)

**Status:** ‚ö†Ô∏è BLOCKED - System dependencies missing
**Reason:** Missing `libevent-2.1-7t64` and `libavif16` libraries

**Error Message:**
```

‚ïë Host system is missing dependencies to run browsers. ‚ïë
‚ïë Please install them with the following command:      ‚ïë

```

**Impact Assessment:**
- **Market Share:** Chrome + Firefox cover ~75% desktop, ~85% mobile
- **MVP Decision:** Safari testing deferred to manual testing on real macOS/iOS devices
- **Risk Level:** LOW - Vanilla JS/CSS has excellent Safari compatibility
- **Mitigation:** Manual testing on iPhone/iPad during mobile testing phase

## üêõ Bugs Fixed During Testing

### P0-001: Duplicate HTML ID (FIXED)

**Severity:** P0 - Critical (Blocking)
**Discovered:** Sessie 16 automated testing
**Impact:** All Playwright tests failed (8/8)

**Root Cause:**
Duplicate `id="legal-modal"` in HTML:
1. Static HTML modal element (line ~45)
2. Dynamically created modal via JavaScript (`src/ui/legal.js`)

**Fix Applied:**
Removed static HTML modal, kept only dynamic creation. Legal.js now has sole responsibility for modal creation.

**Result:** ‚úÖ All tests unblocked, 16/16 passing

---

### Test Assertion Bug: Footer Link Selector Conflict (FIXED)

**Severity:** P1 - High
**Discovered:** During Chromium test run
**Impact:** 1/8 tests failing (Footer links test)

**Root Cause:**
Selector `a[href*="/assets/legal/cookies"]` matched 2 elements:
1. Cookie banner "Meer info" link
2. Footer "Cookies" link

Playwright strict mode threw error on duplicate matches.

**Fix Applied:**
Changed from href-based selectors to role-based selectors:
```javascript
// Before (ambiguous)
const cookiesLink = footer.locator('a[href*="/assets/legal/cookies"]');

// After (specific)
const cookiesLink = footer.getByRole('link', { name: 'Cookies' });
```

**Result:** ‚úÖ Test now passes, more semantic and accessible

---

## üéì Key Learnings

### 1. Test-First Debugging is 10√ó Faster
**Context:** Automated tests found P0-001 bug immediately, would have taken hours of manual testing to reproduce consistently.

**Lesson:** Automated E2E tests catch deployment-specific bugs (like duplicate IDs) that localhost testing misses.

---

### 2. Role-Based Selectors > Attribute Selectors
**Context:** Footer link test failed with `href*=` selector but passed with `getByRole('link', { name: '...' })`.

**Lesson:** Playwright's role-based selectors are:
- **More semantic** (matches how users interact)
- **More specific** (avoids duplicate matches)
- **More accessible** (validates ARIA roles)
- **More resilient** (survives minor HTML changes)

---

### 3. Scoped Selectors Prevent False Positives
**Context:** Even with `footer.locator()` scoping, href-based selectors still matched cookie banner links.

**Lesson:** Browser normalizes relative URLs to absolute URLs at runtime, making partial href matching unreliable. Use text-based matching instead.

---

### 4. Cross-Browser Testing Catches Edge Cases
**Context:** Firefox test duration 50% longer than Chromium, but functionality identical.

**Lesson:** Performance varies across browsers, but vanilla JS/CSS ensures consistent functionality. No browser-specific polyfills needed.
